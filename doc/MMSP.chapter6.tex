\chapter{\MMSP\ Examples}

\section{Introduction}
	The \MMSP\ source code includes a large number of examples implementing
	canonical problems in diffusion, phase transformation, and statistical
	mechanics. These are provided to demonstrate the best practices for
	writing efficient \MMSP\ code and to provide starting points for your
	research. These examples are documented as clearly as possible in the
	{\tt c++} files themselves, with references to academic research papers
	for further details.
